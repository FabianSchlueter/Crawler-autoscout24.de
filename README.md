# Crawler-autoscout24.de

This crawler goes through all results of a previously defined search for cars on the website www.autoscout24.de.
By this you can get data (about 170 features) for 400 car offers at once.

## How to use:
Specify a search on www.autoscout24.de manually. Paste the url of the first result page in the code.

Specify the path where to store the crawled data.

Run the file.

## Example:
Results for the following search can be viewed in the excel sample data [Porsche](/Porsche.xlsx).

https://www.autoscout24.de/lst/porsche/911?sort=age&desc=1&offer=J%2CU%2CO%2CD&ustate=N%2CU&size=20&page=1&cy=D&atype=C&fc=1&qry=&

Running the crawler for this search several times over a few weeks I could gather data for almost 1000 offers.
